# Sushi Neko SpriteKit Code Only

Use SpriteKit and Swift 3 to build a game like [Timberman](http://www.digitalmelody.eu/games/Timberman). This version of this 
tutorial creates the entire game all in code without using SpriteKit Scene (.sks) files.

## What you will learn

The tutorial covers concepts like: 

- Custom Classes and OOP
- Enums 
- SpriteKit's coordinate system
- Creating simple and complex animation with SKAction 
- Use comments to label and organize your code

<!-- list of concepts they will understand after finishing -->

## Common issues

To get effective use out of your custom classes understanding Swift initializers is a must. This can be confusing when 
variables must be initialized before calling `super.init()` while `self` is unavailable until after you call `super.init()`. 

Writing lots of code especially in a new language or framework can lead to haphazardly written code. This tutorial tries 
to present code with a written organization that is easy to follow and use commeents, and `// MARK:` to make code easier to 
navigate. 

<!-- faq list of common issues students run into -->

- Failing to call the Designated or required initializer. 
- Not using Sub classes effectively. 
- Lack of understanding of SpriteKit's coordinate system. 
- Writing unorganized code. 

## What you should understand when finished

By the time you complete this tutorial you should be able to make an app game using SpriteKit. This learning how to create
Sprite nodes, place them on the screen, and apply actions provides limitless possibilities. 

<!-- list of check for understanding questions the student should be able to answer when finished -->

- Subclass sprites, to create custom game objects that encapsulate functionality to easily do the bidding of your scene. 
- Have a basic understanding of SpriteKit's core concepts.
- Understand SpriteKits coordinate system and be able place sprites anywhere on the screen. 
- Use actions to move and animate sprites at your whim.
